**Note:** Do not use this script, it does nothing special
---
# Mark previously translated strings as translated (removes blue dot)
This script will help you get rid of untranslated strings which you have already translated, but appear in the untranslated section because of changes to the string in the base language.

# Conditions
1. On a page with /untranslated/ in the URL, this script will re-submit translation of previously applied strings.
2. This script will ignore new strings added the translation platform.
3. This script will ignore critical strings.

## How to use?
1. Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), or a similar browser extension
2. Install the userscript: **[mark-as-translated.user.js](https://github.com/rondevous/Telegram-Translation-QuickHacks/raw/main/mark-as-translated.user.js)**
3. Open /untranslated/ section of your language, and follow the visibly obvious instruction.
4. Drink tea while it does the job :slightly_smiling_face:

## How to stop the script?
Just reload the page. If you don't want the script to be loaded again, put off the switch in ViolentMonkey and reload the page.
